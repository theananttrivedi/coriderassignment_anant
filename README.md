# üöÄ PWA Chat App - Vite Project

Welcome to the **PWA Chat App**! This mini-project is built to demonstrate the power of Progressive Web Apps (PWA) using the blazing-fast **Vite** as a build tool. The app allows users to scroll through chats with smooth pagination and includes metadata from the API, making the entire chat experience dynamic and engaging.
